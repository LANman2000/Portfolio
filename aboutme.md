# About Me

![Profile Photo](images/profile.jpg)

## Hi, I'm Lanre.

I'm a Computer Science student with a growing focus on **cybersecurity**, **networking**, and **full‑stack development**. I enjoy working at the intersection of systems, security, and clean engineering — building tools and experiences that are reliable, intentional, and thoughtfully designed.

## My Journey Into Computer Science

My path into CS started with curiosity. I’ve always been drawn to understanding how systems work — from the structure of networks to the logic behind software. That curiosity eventually led me to programming, cybersecurity labs, and hands‑on networking environments where I could break things, fix them, and learn from the process.

As I progressed through university coursework and real projects, I found myself gravitating toward areas that require both precision and creativity: secure application design, enterprise networking, and data‑driven systems. Each project has pushed me to think more deeply about how technology behaves and how to build it responsibly.

## What I’m Working On

I’m currently building projects that strengthen my foundation in:

- **Cybersecurity** — PCAP analysis, protocol behavior, and secure development practices  
- **Networking** — VLAN configuration, routing, and enterprise‑scale topologies  
- **Full‑Stack Development** — Astro, Tailwind, Python, SQL, and component‑based UI design  
- **Systems Thinking** — designing architectures that are modular, scalable, and maintainable

## Leadership & Community

I serve as **President of the African Student Association (ASA)**, where I focus on building community, organizing events, and creating spaces where people feel supported and connected. Leadership has taught me how to communicate clearly, collaborate effectively, and guide teams through challenges — skills that translate directly into engineering work.

I’ve also contributed as a **Fundraising Coordinator**, **Social Media Chair**, and **Orientation Leader**, roles that strengthened my ability to plan, communicate, and lead with intention.

## What I Value

- **Clarity** — in code, communication, and design  
- **Security‑minded thinking** — building with intention, not assumptions  
- **Continuous learning** — certifications, labs, and hands‑on experimentation  
- **Teamwork** — because the best engineering happens collaboratively  

These values shape how I approach both technical work and leadership.

## Outside of Tech

When I’m not debugging or configuring networks, I’m usually exploring new tools, learning about AI systems, or working on community initiatives. I enjoy connecting my technical interests with real‑world impact — whether through leadership, mentorship, or creative projects.

## Looking Ahead

I’m preparing for opportunities in **software engineering**, **IT**, and **cybersecurity**, with the long‑term goal of contributing to secure, scalable systems. My portfolio reflects that journey — the projects I’ve built, the problems I’ve solved, and the direction I’m growing toward.
