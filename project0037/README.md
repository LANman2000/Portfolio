# 🧠 YOLO Pose Detection Demo — Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe
A lightweight computer‑vision demo combining YOLOv8 and MediaPipe for pose and object detection. Currently a personal project work in progress. 

## Key Features
- Integrate YOLOv8 for object detection and MediaPipe for pose estimation
- Build a real‑time inference pipeline with OpenCV
- Design a modular script structure for easy model swapping and experimentation

### No demo/screenshots at the moment
